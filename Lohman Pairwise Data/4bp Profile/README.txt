*** ADAM MARTINEZ : JULY 13th, 2020 ***

This fidelity data is from Lohman's 4 base pair overhang experiments.

The data is presented in a matrix form with the ligation events per 10000 of each pair of overhangs is recorded. 

The experimental data also includes different incubation conditions: 

1. 1 hour incubation at 25oC (T4 DNA Ligase) --> FileS01
2. 1 hours incubation at 37oC (T4 DNA Ligase) --> FileS02
3. 18 hours incubation at 25oC (T4 DNA Ligase) --> FileS03
4. 18 hours incubation at 37oC (T4 DNA Ligase) --> FileS04
5. 18 hours incubation at 25oC (T7 DNA Ligase) --> File206
6. 18 hours incubation at 37oC (T7 DNA Ligase) --> FileS08

The data is stored in a .xlsx or .csv file.
